# wordle-solver

A quick piece of code i put together to test my selenium skills. This took about 1:30 to write. 10 minutes of that was setting up the logic in solver.py and the remaining time was banging my head against selenium...

Usage: `python interface.py`

Requires:

    - Python >3.7
    - Pandas
    - selenium
    - numpy 
    - json
